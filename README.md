I challenged myself to get into new field aside from computer science and just out of curiosity, I have decided to learn Digital Marketing.
In this nondegree I had a great journey with Udacity to learn the Digital Marketing concepts which is: value propositions, marketing objectives, KPIs, targeted personas, customer journeys, marketing channels, content strategy, and more.
